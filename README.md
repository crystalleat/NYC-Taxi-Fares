# NYC-Taxi-Fares

This study investigates patterns in New York City taxi fares through unsupervised machine learning techniques, such as K-Means clustering and association rule mining. The objective is to detect pricing irregularities, analyze the effects of congestion charges, and identify inconsistencies among various trip types.
By grouping trips based on fare characteristics and travel behavior, the study reveals distinct pricing structures. Association rule mining is then employed to explore connections between trip factors, including congestion surcharges and interborough travel, offering a deeper understanding of fare dynamics.
